# This test uses a custom "spell checker" defined in corpus/*/dist.ini
# (setting it here didn't work, it seems to get overridden in the do-file)
# to produce reliable output so that we can ensure that each expected
# file (beneath bin/ and lib/) is in fact being tested.
# (We wouldn't want to generate a script that didn't actually check our files).
# Defining a custom one enables us to get reliable results regardless
# of which version of which spell checker (or none at all) is available.

# This test builds the fake dists (in corpus/) with dzil,
# then executes the actual test script generated by this module.
# Test::Tester intercepts the Test::Builder calls to allow us to verify
# which tests have been run (for example 'spelling ok for lib/Foo.pm').

# lib/ and bin/
# (bin/foo should be 'not ok' because of a spelling error)
