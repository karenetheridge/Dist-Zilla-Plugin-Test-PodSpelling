=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PodSpelling - Author tests for POD spelling

=head1 VERSION

version 2.007006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In C<dist.ini>:

    [Test::PodSpelling]

or:

    [Test::PodSpelling]
    directory = docs
    wordlist = Pod::Wordlist
    spell_cmd = aspell list
    stopword = CPAN
    stopword = github
    stopword = stopwords
    stopword = wordlist

If you're using C<[ExtraTests]> it must come after C<[Test::PodSpelling]>,
it's worth noting that this ships in the C<[@Basic]> bundle so you may have to
remove it from that first.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a plugin that runs at the L<gather files|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer> stage,
providing the file:

  xt/author/pod-spell.t - a standard Test::Spelling test

L<Test::Spelling> will be added as a develop prerequisite.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 directories (or directory)

Additional directories you wish to search for POD spell checking purposes.
C<bin> and C<lib> are set by default.

=head2 wordlist

The module name of a word list you wish to use that works with
L<Test::Spelling>.

Defaults to L<Pod::Wordlist>.

=head2 spell_cmd

If C<spell_cmd> is set then C<set_spell_cmd( your_spell_command );> is
added to the test file to allow for custom spell check programs.

Defaults to nothing.

=head2 stopwords

If stopwords is set then C<< add_stopwords( <DATA> ) >> is added
to the test file and the words are added after the C<__DATA__>
section.

C<stopword> or C<stopwords> can appear multiple times, one word per line.

Normally no stopwords are added by default, but author names appearing in
C<dist.ini> are automatically added as stopwords so you don't have to add them
manually just because they might appear in the C<AUTHORS> section of the
generated POD document. The same goes for contributors listed under the
'x_contributors' field on your distributions META file.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_stopword

Called to add stopwords to the stopwords array. It is used to determine if
automagically detected words are valid and print out debug logging for the
process.
